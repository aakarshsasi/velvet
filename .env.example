# iOS Public SDK Key (required for iOS)
REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_ios_api_key_here

# Android Public SDK Key (add when implementing Android support)
# REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID=your_android_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys
# 3. Never commit the .env file to git

# Note: Public SDK keys are safe to use in the app
# They're called "public" because they're embedded in your app
# RevenueCat handles all sensitive operations on their servers
